Our application is a job board that automates some of the preliminary aspects of the interview process(resume screening, preliminary 
interview questions) in an effort to save both employers and prospective employees time and money.

The main technologies we used to develop our applicaton are Java, Thymeleaf, Spring MVC, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, and H2/SQL.
